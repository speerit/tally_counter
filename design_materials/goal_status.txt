statusString psudeo code
is goal satisfied?
  if so:
    TL was the time of the earliest tally needed to accomplish goal
    interval is the time window in days
    T0 is now
    delT = T0-TL is how long it's been since last finished
    remainT = interval(ms)-delT is how many miliseconds until goal is no longer
    format remainT as desired
  if not:
    sum tallies over interval:: goalProgress
    targetDiff= target-goalProgress
is anti goal satisfied?
  if so:
    sum tallies over interval:: goalProgress
    targetDiff = target-goalProgress
    if targetDiff is greater than 0
      report targetDiff
    else
      report like goal is unsatisfied
  if not:
    TL was time stamp when targetDiff became 0
    T0 is now
    delT is TL-T0
    remainT is interval - delT
